# O-Ring Inspection Assignment
##### Computer Vision 4th Year Assignment using Java & OpenCV

* OpenCV only used to read, display and annotate the output images.
* All image processing is custom code.

#### Processing Steps:

1. Create & display histogram of O-Ring image.
2. Perform binary morphology (dilation & erosion)
3. Perform Connected Component Labelling (CCL) to remove any imperfections in the images.
4. Analyse the image to determine if the O-Ring is flawed or not.
5. Display the result (pass or fail) using an OpenCV Annotation.
6. Display original & all resulting images after each step in the JFrame.
7. Calculate the processing time for each image.
